                    <dt>Ancient History</dt>
                    <dd>Assam has a long history of various ancient civilizations. It was part of the Maurya Empire and
                        the ancient kingdom of Kamarupa. The region was known for its strategic location and cultural
                        diversity, with various ethnic groups living in harmony.</dd>

                    <dt>Medieval Period</dt>
                    <dd>In the medieval period, Assam was ruled by various dynasties, including the Varman and Koch
                        dynasties. The Ahom dynasty, which ruled Assam for over 600 years, played a significant role in
                        shaping the culture and administration of the region. The Ahoms successfully repelled several
                        invasions from the Mughals.</dd>

                    <dd>Assam came under British rule in the 19th century. During this period, the British expanded the
                        tea industry and constructed railways, leading to significant changes in the economy and
                        society. Assam became a part of the British Indian Empire until India gained independence in
                        1947.</dd>

                    <dt>Post-Independence</dt>
                    <dd>After India’s independence, Assam became a major political and cultural center in the
                        northeastern region. The state faced challenges related to ethnic conflicts, political
                        movements, and the demand for autonomy by various communities, but it has gradually developed in
                        recent years.</dd>
