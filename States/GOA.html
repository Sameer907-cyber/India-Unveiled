                    <dt>Ancient History</dt>
                    <dd>Goa has a rich historical background, with evidence of human settlements dating back to the
                        Stone Age. It was known as a part of the Maurya Empire and later the Satavahana dynasty. The
                        region was also known for its involvement in the maritime trade routes.</dd>

                    <dt>Medieval Period</dt>
                    <dd>Goa was ruled by various dynasties, including the Kadambas and the Vijayanagara Empire. In the
                        early 16th century, the Portuguese arrived, marking the beginning of over four centuries of
                        Portuguese rule. During this period, Goa became a center of trade, culture, and Christianity.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Post-Independence</dt>
                    <dd>After India gained independence in 1947, Goa remained a Portuguese colony until 1961, when it
                        was integrated into India. This event is commemorated annually on Liberation Day (December 19).
                        Since then, Goa has developed as a major tourist destination and is known for its progressive
                        policies and strong economy.</dd>
