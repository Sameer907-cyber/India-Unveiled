                    <dt>Ancient History</dt>
                    <dd>The history of Manipur can be traced back to ancient times, with evidence of early human
                        habitation and the rise of the kingdom of Kangleipak (ancient Manipur). The region has been
                        ruled by various dynasties, and the history of the Manipuri people is marked by the rise and
                        fall of these kingdoms.</dd>

                    <dt>Colonial Era</dt>
                    <dd>During the British colonial period, Manipur became a princely state under British suzerainty in
                        the 19th century. The state experienced several conflicts with the British, notably the Manipur
                        uprising in 1891, when the Manipuri king, Bir Tikendrajit Singh, resisted British annexation.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Post-Independence</dt>
                    <dd>Manipur became a part of India in 1949 when it merged with the Indian Union, and in 1972, it was
                        officially made a Union Territory. In 1987, it became a full-fledged state of India. The state
                        has since struggled with political unrest, insurgency, and efforts to address issues related to
                        autonomy and self-determination.</dd>
