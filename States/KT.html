                    <dt>Ancient History</dt>
                    <dd>The history of Karnataka dates back to the ancient times with the presence of the Maurya Empire
                        and the Satavahanas. Karnataka's early history is marked by several powerful dynasties like the
                        Kadambas, Chalukyas, and Rashtrakutas.</dd>

                    <dt>Medieval Period</dt>
                    <dd>In the medieval period, the Vijayanagara Empire, founded by Harihara and Bukka, dominated the
                        Deccan region, with Hampi being the capital. The empire was one of the most prosperous in Indian
                        history and contributed immensely to the culture and architecture of the region.</dd>

                    <dt>Modern History</dt>
                    <dd>After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, the region came under the influence of various
                        colonial powers, including the Marathas, Mughals, and later the British. Following India’s
                        independence in 1947, Karnataka was formed as a state in 1956 through the reorganization of
                        states.</dd>
