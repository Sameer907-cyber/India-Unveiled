                        Route.</dd>

                    <dt>Medieval Era</dt>
                    <dd>During the medieval period, Sikkim was ruled by the Chogyal dynasty, which was founded in the
                        17th century. The Chogyals were the monarchs of Sikkim, and they held power until the state’s
                        merger with India.</dd>

                        following a referendum, Sikkim became the 22nd state of India, officially ending its monarchy.
