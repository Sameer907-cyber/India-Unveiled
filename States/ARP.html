                    <dd>Arunachal Pradesh is a state located in the northeastern part of India, bordered by China
                        (Tibet) to the north, Myanmar to the east, and the Indian states of Assam and Nagaland to the
                        south. It is known for its pristine natural beauty, rich biodiversity, and vibrant culture. The
                        state is often referred to as the "Land of the Rising Sun" because it is the first place in
                        India to receive the sunrise each day. It is one of the least populated states in India and has
                        a diverse ethnic population, primarily comprising indigenous tribes.</dd>

                    <dt>Ancient History</dt>
                    <dd>The region of Arunachal Pradesh has a rich and diverse history, with evidence of human
                        habitation dating back to ancient times. It was inhabited by various indigenous tribal
                        communities, each with their own distinct culture and traditions. The area was initially part of
                        the kingdom of Assam, and later came under the influence of the British during colonial rule.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>British Rule</dt>
                    <dd>During British rule, Arunachal Pradesh was considered a part of the North East Frontier Agency
                        (NEFA). The British government focused on maintaining the region's strategic importance due to
                        its proximity to Tibet and China. The region remained largely isolated, and its indigenous
                        people maintained their traditional lifestyles.</dd>

                    <dt>Post-Independence</dt>
                    <dd>After India gained independence in 1947, Arunachal Pradesh was made a Union Territory. It became
                        a full-fledged state on February 20, 1987. Since then, the state has faced challenges related to
                        its geographic location, socio-economic development, and its relationship with neighboring
                        countries, particularly China.</dd>
