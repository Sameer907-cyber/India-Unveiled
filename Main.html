      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>India has the largest and the most boundless history in the world. INDIA'S history is believed to be
        8,000
        years old
        and some studies even suggest that it might be much older.In India, many dynasties and kingdoms
        flourished
        due to
        strong leadership, rich resources, and strategic trade routes. Powerful rulers expanded their
        territories
        through
        wars and alliances, while advancements in art, culture, and administration helped them thrive. However,
        over
        time,
        internal conflicts, weak successors, foreign invasions, and economic decline led to their downfall.
        Empires
        like
        the Mauryas, Guptas, Mughals, and Cholas once ruled vast lands but eventually disappeared, leaving
        behind

            <h3>Prehistoric Era [Before 3000 BCE]</h3>
            <h4>Early Human Settlements:</h4>
            <p>India has one of the oldest records of human habitation. The first human settlements in India
              date back to
              around 100,000 years ago, with evidence found in caves like Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh,
              where ancient rock
              paintings have
              been discovered. Early humans in India were likely hunter-gatherers, using stone tools to
              survive.
            </p>
            <h4>Stone Age Developments:</h4>
            <dl>
              <dt>Paleolithic [Old Stone Age]</dt>
              <dd>-Humans in this period lived in caves and used simple stone tools for hunting and
                gathering. Evidence of these
                tools has been found in various sites across India, such as in the Narmada Valley.</dd>
              <dt>Mesolithic [Middle Stone Age]</dt>
              <dd>-This period saw a shift toward more refined tools and a gradual change in diet, with
                humans relying more on
                fishing, hunting smaller game, and gathering plant materials.</dd>
              <dt>Neolithic [New Stone Age]</dt>
              <dd>-By 8000 BCE, agriculture began to emerge in the Indian subcontinent, especially in the
                fertile river
                valleys of the Indus and Ganges. Early farming practices and the domestication of
                animals marked the shift
                to settled life.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Indus Valley Civilization [3300-1300 BCE]</h3>
            <p>The Indus Valley Civilization (also known as the Harappan Civilization) was one of the
              earliest urban
              societies in the world.</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Urban Planning</dt>
              <dd>-The Major cities like Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, and Dholavira featured sophisticated urban
                planning,
                with well-laid streets, drainage systems, and public bathhouses.</dd>
              <dt>Economic and Trade Networks</dt>
              <dd>-The Harappans were skilled in pottery, bead-making, and metallurgy (working with
                copper, bronze, and gold).
                They traded extensively with regions like Mesopotamia, evidenced by Indus seals found in
                Mesopotamian sites.
                The civilization
                also had an advanced system of weights and measures.</dd>
              <dt>Writing System</dt>
              <dd>-The Harappans used a script, but it has not yet been deciphered, making it difficult to
                fully understand
                their social, political, and religious practices. However, the civilization's
                innovations in urbanization,
                trade, and craftsmanship are well-recognized.</dd>

            <h3>Vedic Period [1500-500 BCE]</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>Aryan Migration</dt>
              <dd>-The Vedic period began with the arrival of the Indo-Aryans, believed to have migrated
                into the
                Indian subcontinent around 1500 BCE. They composed the sacred texts known as the VEDAS,
                which laid the
                foundation of Hindu philosophy.</dd>
              <dt>Social Structure and the Caste System</dt>
              <dd>-The early Aryans organized society into four primary varnas (classes): Brahmins
                (priests), Kshatriyas
                (warriors), Vaishyas (merchants), and Shudras (laborers). Over time, this evolved into
                the caste system, a
                rigid social hierarchy.</dd>
              <dt>Religious and Philosophical Development</dt>
              <dd>-The Vedas are the primary source of knowledge about this period, and they describe
                rituals, hymns, and
                philosophies.
                The UPANISHADS, philosophical texts written toward the end of the Vedic period, explored
                deeper
                metaphysical questions,
                focusing on concepts like BRAHMAN (the ultimate reality) and ATMAN (the self).
              </dd>
              <dt>Hinduism's Roots</dt>
              <dd>-This period is essential for the development of Hinduism, with the gods and rituals
                described in the Vedic
                texts becoming central to the religion. Key deities include INDRA (god of war), AGNI
                (god of fire), and VARUNA
                (god of water and cosmic order).</dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Mahajanapada Period [600-300 BCE]</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>Rise Of Powerful Kingdoms</dt>
              <dd>-By the 6th century BCE, India saw the rise of powerful kingdoms known as MAHAJANAPADAS,
                which were large,
                prosperous, and often in conflict with one another. There were 16 major kingdoms,
                including MAGADHA, KOSALA,
                VATSA, and KASHI.</dd>
              <dt>Religious Movements</dt>
              <dd>-This period also saw the rise of new religious movements in India. BUDDHISM, founded by
                Siddhartha Gautama
                (Buddha), and JAINISM, founded by Mahavira, emerged as reformist movements against the
                ritualistic practices
                of Vedic religion. Both religions rejected the caste system and emphasized personal
                spiritual growth.
              </dd>
              <dt>Buddhism And Jainism</dt>
              <dd>-Buddhism taught the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, while Jainism emphasized
                non-violence (ahimsa)
                and the idea of liberation through self-discipline.

              <dt>Ashoka The Great</dt>
              <dd>-Chandragupta's grandson, ASHOKA, is one of the most famous rulers in Indian history.
                Initially a
                conqueror, Ashoka adopted BUDDHISM after the bloody Kalinga War and became a proponent
                of peace,
                non-violence, and social welfare. His edicts, inscribed on pillars, promoted moral
                governance and Buddhist
                teachings.
              </dd>
              <dt>Administrative and Economic Reforms</dt>
              <dd>-ASHOKA established a centralized administration with a complex bureaucracy. The empire
                facilitated trade
                and built infrastructure like roads, rest houses, and irrigation systems. The Mauryan
                Empire also had a
                sophisticated taxation system that funded its army and public works.

      <h2>Politics</h2>
      <div class="content-grid">
        <div class="content-card">
          <h3>Political System</h3>
          <div class="content-text">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>India is the world's largest democracy, with a federal parliamentary system modeled on the British
              Westminster system. It is a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic as stated in its
              Constitution. Political power is distributed between the central government and the state governments,
              allowing for a balance of regional and national interests.</p>

            <h3>Structure of the Indian Government</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt><strong>Executive</strong></dt>
              <dd>The President of India is the constitutional head of the country, while the Prime Minister is the
                head of the government. The executive branch includes the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime
                Minister.</dd>

              <dt><strong>Legislature</strong></dt>
              <dd>India has a bicameral parliament consisting of the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha
                (House of the People). The Lok Sabha is directly elected by the people and holds more power in
                legislative affairs.</dd>

              <dt><strong>Judiciary</strong></dt>
              <dd>India has an independent judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. It plays a crucial role in
                upholding the Constitution, interpreting laws, and delivering justice.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>Major Political Parties</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt><strong>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</strong></dt>
              <dd>A right-wing party with a nationalist ideology. It is currently the ruling party at the central
                level.</dd>

              <dt><strong>Indian National Congress (INC)</strong></dt>
              <dd>A centrist party that played a crucial role in India's independence. It promotes secularism and
                social democracy.</dd>

              <dt><strong>Regional Parties</strong></dt>
              <dd>States like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana have strong regional parties such as the TMC,
                DMK, and TRS respectively, which influence both state and national politics.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>Electoral System</h3>
            <p>India conducts general elections every five years to elect members of the Lok Sabha. State elections
              are also held every five years unless early elections are called. The Election Commission of India
              oversees and ensures free and fair elections across the country. India uses the **first-past-the-post**
              system for elections.</p>

            <h3>Role of the President and Prime Minister</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt><strong>President</strong></dt>
              <dd>The ceremonial head of state, elected indirectly by an electoral college. The President’s role is
                mostly symbolic but important in certain constitutional crises.</dd>

              <dt><strong>Prime Minister</strong></dt>
              <dd>The most powerful political figure in India. The Prime Minister leads the executive branch and the
                Council of Ministers, formulates policy, and represents India internationally.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Center-State Relations</h3>
            <p>India's federal structure divides powers between the Centre and the States through three lists in the
              Constitution: the Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent List. Disputes over jurisdiction and
              revenue-sharing are resolved through mechanisms such as the Inter-State Council and the Finance
              Commission.</p>

            <h3>Key Political Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Corruption and lack of transparency</li>
              <li>Communal and caste-based politics</li>
              <li>Low voter turnout in urban areas</li>
              <li>Political polarization and misinformation</li>
              <li>Criminalization of politics (candidates with criminal records)</li>
            </ul <h3>Recent Political Developments</h3>
            <p>In recent years, Indian politics has seen a significant shift with the rise of the BJP and a more
              centralized style of governance. Political discourse has increasingly focused on issues like
              nationalism, economic reforms, digital infrastructure, social welfare schemes, and foreign policy
              strategies like "Act East" and "Neighborhood First."</p>
